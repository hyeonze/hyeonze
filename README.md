### Front-End Engineer
- Hello! I am Hyunjae Ahn, a front-end developer.
- I first encountered web development in an internal club for programming education, and I was interested in the experience of dealing with web browsers that are closely related to real life, so I started front-end development.
- I like to learn new things and share the things I've been thinking about with my colleagues. I want to experience a variety of projects, generate profits in the company, and develop together.
